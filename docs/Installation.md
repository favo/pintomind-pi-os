# Installation guide for PinToMindOS

## Prerequisites
It might be a good idea to buy a Raspberry Pi 4 starter kit. We recommend getting 
a model with at least 4 GB of RAM. If you choose to not buy a kit, you will need: 
- Raspberry Pi 4 (4/8 GB RAM)
- Micro SD card (8 GB or more, preferably at least 16 GB)
- Power supply (USB-C, 5V, 3A, preferably the official one)
- Micro HDMI Cable or adapter
- Case (recommended)
- Ethernet cable (if wired network is used)

During setup, you will also need:
- A keyboard and mouse
- A MicroSD Card reader
- A PC or Mac with SD card flashing software. We recommend using 
  [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), which is also what we use in 
  this guide.

## Download and flash the image
(Etcher did not work for me, so I can't write this guide right now)

## Setup
Once the image has been flashed, remove it from your computer, and insert it into 
a Raspberry Pi. Connect the Raspberry Pi to a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and 
an Ethernet cable if you use wired networking. Finally, connect the power supply 
to the Pi to boot it. The Pi should now show some system information, before showing 
the Favo logo. After a minute or two (could take longer if the SD card is slow), 
it should show the PinToMind setup screen. 

### Wired setup
If you use wired networking, you should be taken straight to the PinToMind setup 
screen, where it shows a unique setup code. On a different device, go to 
[https://app.pintomind.com](https://app.pintomind.com), and log in with your 
PinToMind account. Add a new screen, enter the setup code, and select a channel. 
Within seconds, you should be up and running successfully.
